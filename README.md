## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create a small-scale replica of the Amazon.com website. Through the process of replicating key features and design elements, I've aimed to deepen my understanding of web development concepts and improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Learning Highlights

This project has provided several opportunities for learning and growth:

- **JavaScript Functions:** Exploring and implementing various JavaScript functions has enhanced my ability to create dynamic and interactive web elements.

- **HTML Generation:** Generating HTML elements programmatically has given me a better understanding of how to structure content efficiently.

- **Modules:** Organizing code into modules has improved code maintainability and readability, allowing me to work more effectively.

- **DOM Manipulation:** Working with the Document Object Model (DOM) has taught me how to dynamically update and modify web page content.

## Project Status

The project is currently in progress. I've successfully recreated core components and functionalities of Amazon.com. While it's not a complete replica, it demonstrates my progress in applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.

### Features Implemented
